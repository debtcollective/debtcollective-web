        <h3>What is the Debt Collective?</h3>
        <p>As part of our work in Strike Debt, we launched the Rolling Jubilee to promote public education about the injustice of requiring public goods, such as education and healthcare, to be personally debt-financed. Rolling Jubilee was intended to be a spark and not a solution, and our long-term aim has always been to transform personal grievances into collective political action by helping people realize that they are not “a loan.” Debt collectives, effectively debtors' unions, are the next stage. Only by organizing together, through the pursuit of collective bargaining and debt strikes, can ... </p>

        <h3>What's the red square?</h3>
        <p>The red square was first used as a symbol in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Quebec_student_protests">the student strikes in 2005 and again in 2012 in Quebec.</a> The government in Quebec wanted to charge college students tuition and fees for the first time. Students walked out of class to protest, and the strikes lasted several months. Half of Quebec's student population was involved by 2012. Hundreds of thousands of people joined the students in support until the government halted the plan to impose tuition. Srike Debt adopted the red square as the general symbol of debt resistance in 2012, and it has been in widespread use since then.

        <h3>Why join the Debt Collective?</h3>
        <p>Creditors profit from the data they have about our loans. We all owe, but we aren’t always sure who really profits from our loan payments. Who is at the end of that paper trail? We can learn where our money goes and who is profiting from those payments. We can also learn who stands to lose when we don’t pay. This kind of knowledge could help us work together to renegotiate our payments or even demand the cancellation of illegitimate debts.

        <h3>What is the Corinthian Collective?</h3>
        <p>The Corinthian collective is a group of people who attended Corinthian College and a pilot project of the Debt Collective. Working together, organizers and students are demanding a full discharge of student loans held by Everest, Heald, and Wyotech. In spring 2014, the Rolling Jubilee purchased and abolished $4 million in debt held by Everest students. Since then, Debt Collective organizers have continued to support students as they seek a full refund and...</p>
