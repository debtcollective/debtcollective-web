          <strong>We are prepared to stop paying our federal student loans in support of Corinthian students.</strong> We did not all attend a Corinthian college. We are current and former students from other schools, public and private, for-proft and non-proft; we are young and old; some of us grew up in low-income families, while others had more privileges and opportunities; we are from everywhere. </p>
          <p>We are outraged that, like the Corinthian students, we have been forced to mortgage our futures and the futures of our families for education, and that we have had to do so in a country where a tiny minority controls the vast majority of the wealth.</p>

          <p>Most of us already fnd our degrees worthless, our jobs non-existent, our prospects bleak, our debts unpayable, and our bank accounts drained by the Department of Education’s brutal collection tactics. But even those of us who don’t yet face these circumstances have chosen to stand now in solidarity with the <a class="big-link" href="/studentstrike">Corinthian strikers.</a></p>

          <p>To the Department of Education, we say: Cancel all Corinthian students’ federal loans. Doing so will demonstrate your commitment to your job as a regulator.</p>

          <h6>Our Pledge of Solidarity with the Corinthian Student Debt Strikers</h6>
        </p>
        <p id='terms'><em>Our solidarity comes with a commitment to action. If the Corinthians’ demands are not met, we are prepared to stop payments on our own federal loans.</em></p>

          <p>Those of us not yet in default will sign up for deferments, forbearances and zero dollar income-based repayment plans. Many of us can move from program to program and avoid paying for years. We know that non-payment comes with serious consequences. But many of us already know the consequences too well. The rest of us are prepared, in the end, to default on our federal student loans rather than voluntarily allow your corrupt agency to extract one cent from us. </p>
          <p> To the Department of Education, we say: Cancel all Corinthian students’ federal loans. Doing so will demonstrate your commitment to your job as a regulator. Continue to avoid your responsibility, and you will face the consequences of the reality you helped create: millions of us have been crushed by debts from the education that was supposed to enable our future. We say: enough is enough!</p>
