{"Name":"Demond Bivins","Striker Bio":"I gradauted from Everest in 2013. I wanted to go to college and become a success.  By the time I graduated from high school I didn't know what I wanted major in so I didn't go straight to college.  I regret that decision looking back on it because I could've easily chose my major once I got into college.  By the time I was 21 I decided to follow in my cousin's footsteps and decided to go back to school.  We both applied for everest university and decided to major and web design.  Most of the courses we took weren't even related to our major, and the courses we took that were related to our major were mediocre at best. My cousin ended up dropping out, but I decided to continue based off the fact that I didn't want to give up on becoming a web designer.  By the time I graduated from Everest I felt like I was cheated out of an education.  I had limited knowledge of web design, my portfolio was crap. And from the skills that I gained. I couldn't even apply for web design internship. As far their career services, it was complete crap.  They told me that they were going to help me find a job, but they didn't. I graduated with over $26 thousand in debt and owe the school over $300 dollars for pretty much nothing.\n","Photo URL":"http://imgur.com/HwFkoy5.jpg","Location":"Georgia"}

{"Name":"Kristy Clifford","Striker Bio":"I graduated from Everest Institute/Corinthian, in Kalamazoo, MI in 2008 from their Dental Assistant program. When I first took interest in the school I set up an appointment with a counselor to just take a tour and to get more information about the programs they offered. I went in to see if it was something I would be interested in. I had no plans to sign up for anything that day. But by the end of our tour, the counselor was gathering information to see if I qualified for financial aid. I was told if I signed up for the dental assisting program it would cost $5000 - $6000 in total. At that time, it sounded affordable. Plus, Everest made lots of promises about the money I could earn later. So I signed up (signed my life away, it turns out) that day. I began the dental program a month later. On two occasions, counselors came right into the classroom and said that it was going to cost more than they had expected and that, in order to continue the dental program, I had to agree and sign a paper saying that I was ok with paying more. I remember feeling pressured and frustrated. After I graduated, I got a job at a dental office. That is when I realized how little the school had actually trained me and that the program was a huge waste of time.\n\nTotal loans-$14940.98 after late charges and other fees\n1 Stafford- $4043.97\n2 Stafford- $5097.01\n3 AES/ Express Loan- $5800, I settled out of court and paid off $2300\n\nI don't understand how what was originally supposed to cost $5000 jumped to $12000. I would have never signed up if they had told me it was going to cost that much. I am now 28-years old not in the dental field because it did not provide enough income. I work in a factory and have a 2-year old son. Going to that school was the worst decision I have ever made. I am depressed and feel like I failed in life when in reality I was conned by Everest and by the Department of Education.

{"Name":"Jenny Leadford","Striker Bio":"In 2009, I decided to go back to school to prepare for a new career. My husand was injured while serving in the military, and he could no longer do his job. I needed to prepare for a career so I could help support my family. I inquired about earning a degree online through the Everest campus in Florida. As soon as I contacted them, they started calling me several times per week with a high-pressure sales pitch. I finally enrolled. All the classes were based on getting students to answer multiple-choice questions. I never spoke to a human being. I don’t feel like I got the education I hoped for. During my last semester, I was told that I needed to apply for yet another student loan or I wouldn’t be able to complete my Bachelor’s degree. I felt like I had no choice but to borrow more so I could finish what I started. It was a shakedown. Now, I owe more than $56,000. Including interest, I would have to pay more than $103,000. But Navient and the Dept. of Education will ever see a penny if I can help it. Corinthian did not hold up their end of the bargain. My husband served our country in the U.S. military. Our family – and all families – deserve better. The Department of Education should discharge these loans. \n","Photo URL":"http://imgur.com/pXtm1L9.jpg","Location":"Woodville, TX"}

{"Name":"Lynn Mangum","Striker Bio":"I attended Everest in West Valley, Utah to earn a Paralegal degree. I was told I would get an internship after graduation and that Everest would help with my job search. But they did none of those things. They also told me that I didn’t qualify for any federal grant money, but I now know that was a lie. They took out loans in my name to enrich their shareholders and the people at the top of the company. I’m left with a worthless degree and $20,000 in debt that I can’t pay. The creditors are now threatening to garnish my wages. I’m suffering the consequences of Corinthian misdeeds, while the people who profited from me have not been punished. I’m proud to stand with others as part of the Corinthian strike until the Department of Education cancels our loans. ","Photo URL":"http://imgur.com/6e8UBeI.jpg","Location":"Salt Lake City, Utah"}

{"Name":"Jason Gardner","Striker Bio":"I attended Everest to earn a degree in a technology field. The whole experience was hokey. Sometimes, the teachers didn’t show up, and Everest kept charging me after I dropped out. Then I found out my credits wouldn’t transfer to any other schools, even though I was told they would. Now I owe thousands for a worthless degree, and I get harassing calls from debt collectors, including from ECMC, the debt collector that now owns Corinthian. I am tired of this harassment. My loans are already in default. I’ve been on strike for years. I’m glad that more people are finally stepping up and fighting back against the school and demanding that the Dept. of Education do its job and cancel this debt.

{"Name":"Angela Tishler","Striker Bio":"I started Everest Online with the impression I'd be paying this small amount for a big future. Instead I was forced into debt without my knowledge. They misrepresented the program costs and kept me unaware of the financial hole I was in until it was too late. I had to stay and finish because they took so much from me I couldn't attend classes any where else. No one wants my diploma nor will they take my credits. I have a family to support and I am not going to be a victim. All I wanted was to be the first person in my family to go to college and have a better life but Everest was out to fill their pockets.","Photo URL":"https://imgur.com/nkYijzo.jpg","Location":"Florida"}

{"Name":"Rocky Valencia","Striker Bio":"I am hard working guy. When I went to Everest, I was working for a law firm. I wanted to earn a paralegal degree. I did well and graduated in 2014. I wanted to pursue a career as an attorney, so I went to a university to further my education. During the enrollment I found out that I could not transfer my credits from Everest and was informed that I would have to start all over again and spend another two years pursuing an associate’s degree. This was very upsetting news. I had worked so hard for two years. At times I barely had money to pay tuition along with other school expenses, but I stayed positive. I was sure that hard work would pay off. In the end, Everest handed me a paper degree worth NOTHING AT ALL. JUST A DEBT OF $34,000.00. I am standing with others until the Department of Education cancels my loans. \n","Photo URL":"http://imgur.com/xfcLO0o.jpg","Location":"California"}

{"Name":"Catrina Beverly","Striker Bio":"I am a 33 year old woman who wanted to move beyond the call center environment. That is why I went to Heald; to get the education needed to switch from customer service to health care. My job had been outsourced in September 2012, and I did not want to go through my job being outsourced again. The saleswoman I talked to at Heald pushed me to finish all the paperwork needed to enroll that same day instead of me being able to go home to think of my options carefully. I went to school full-time for a little over a year to get my AAS. \nMy externship was a joke. The coordinator for Medical Office Administration placed me in an office where they required you to be fluent in Spanish in order to get hired. If I had known that before I would have demanded to be placed somewhere else. So I wasted my four hours a day (before I went to my paying job of 40+ hours a week) scanning medical documents so the office would be in compliance with American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. I got a nice letter of recommendation from the office manager but that was about it. Plus I was locked out of the school computer a couple of times when I fell behind on the Genesis Loan repayment.  When it came to actually try to find a job in my career choice, the career center was of no help. All my advisor did was email links from Craigs List for possible jobs. After a month or so I quit even getting that. When graduation came in July of 2014, I was so disgusted at what I had learned  how Corinthian Colleges inflated the numbers of people actually being hired I did not attend graduation. If I had known this before I started attending Heald I would never have signed up in the first place.  This experience with Corinthian Colleges and Heald has made me very leery to go to even a non-profit school to continue my education. I feel I was taken advantage of and lied to. Heald is such a joke. When it came time to pick up my “degree” they had not even capitalized the H in their name and it just came in a simple manila envelope. I had to shake my head in disgust when I was handed the envelope. A few months later I ended up at a another call center job  but that was due to my experience not from my education from Heald. I ended up exactly at something I did not want to do again and for all these reasons as well as the fraudulent activity of Corinthian Colleges. I declare any agreements I signed with them to be null and void and I refuse to pay loans the government has covertly sanctioned as a way of debt servitude with little or no oversight on these for-profit “schools”. \n\n","Photo URL":"http://i.imgur.com/BsTJM7F.jpg","Location":"Concord, Ca"}

{"Name":"Brittany Prock","Striker Bio":"Corinthian maxed out my federal aid and required me to take out private student loans In order to continue my schooling. They lied to me continuously. They promised a good education, preparation for a career, and help with job placement. I got none of things. now I am fighting back with others in my situation. We won't back down until our demands are met. I recently gave birth to twins. They are the love of my life. I will not let the Dept of Ed or Corinthian steal my babies' futures before they even get a chance to have one. \n ","Photo URL":"http://imgur.com/i7kLBLm.jpg","Location":"Merit, Texas"}

{"Name":"Elizabeth Diaz","Striker Bio":"I attended Everest in Skokie, IL to earn a degree in Massage Therapy. I was 18-years old, and I didn’t have any experience in higher education. When I enrolled, I told Everest admissions officials that I did not have a high school diploma or a GED. They told me this would not be a problem and that they would help me complete my GED. Nine months later, right before graduation, I was told that I couldn’t graduate with my class. I was stopped in my tracks. I can’t afford to make payments on the debt I am stuck with. I owe almost $10,000, and I have nothing but a broken dream. I am a single mother. I get by paycheck to paycheck. I have a low wage job, and what little I do make is being garnished by ECMC, the same company that bought Corinthian. I was inspired by the Corinthian 15. I feel their pain. I want the public to hear my story. I want Corinthian to know that they can’t get away with treating people this way. I want the Department of Education to cancel my debt and the debts of all other Corinthian students. \n","Photo URL":"http://imgur.com/Cyxm5V9.jpg","Location":"Grand Rapids, Michigan"}

{"Name":"Allison Webb","Striker Bio":"I decided to go to Everest because of its small class sizes and the promise that they would help me find a job upon graduation. Every semester, enrollment counselors explained that I had to sign what I now know to be loan documents, in order to register. Every semester, I had to take out more loans to pay for books that they reprinted every term, and would not buy back. When I graduated with honors, I thought I had done everything right, and I thought I would have the credentials to get a good job. It was not until after I graduated that I realized that not only would Everest not help me find a job, but that many other institutions/employers did not recognize them as a legitimate school. When I decided to pursue a different career, not one of my credits transferred over, and so I have to start over again, with massive amounts of student loan debt. I refuse to pay for an illegitimate education that has proven to be excessively expensive, and yet, worthless.","Photo URL":"https://imgur.com/UdUSdZZ.jpg","Location":"New York"}
